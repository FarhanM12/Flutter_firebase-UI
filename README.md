# Flutter Firebase Login Page

Welcome to my Flutter project! This project showcases a simple Flutter UI Login page integrated with Firebase authentication. This is my first project, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Getting Started
This project serves as a starting point for Flutter application development, especially if you're interested in integrating Firebase authentication into your apps.

If you're new to Flutter development, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different features, and customize the UI to your liking. Happy coding!
